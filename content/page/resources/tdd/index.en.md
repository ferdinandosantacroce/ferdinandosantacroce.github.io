I'm getting rid of my browser bookmarks, so this page is born 😄  
This is a list about TDD, a place where I append interesting things I'm discovering about TDD since 2008...  
Today is a massive, incomplete and unordered mess of links, but this leaves me more room for improvement 😁  
Anyway, great value is assured 😄.

## Books

[eXtreme Programming eXplained, 1st ed.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1001606.eXtreme_Programming_eXplained_)
The 1st edition of the book that started it all...

[eXtreme Programming eXplained, 2nd ed.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67833.Extreme_Programming_Explained)
A revised edition with new stuff: it's actually a different book, not an update of the 1st edition.
I recommend to read both the editions, in chronological order of course.

[Test Driven Development: By Example](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387190.Test_Driven_Development)
Learn how to do TDD directly from its inventor.
