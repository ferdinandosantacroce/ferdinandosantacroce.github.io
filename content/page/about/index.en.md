When I started teaching Information Technology right after my diploma in 1998, I never imagined I'd spend the next 27 years falling deeper in love with software and the people who create it. What began as building simple school websites evolved into a passion for helping teams write software that genuinely makes users happy and companies thrive.

I'm someone who believes that great software comes from great teams, and great teams need the right environment to flourish. My journey from developer to coach has taught me that technology is just the tool - it's the human connections, clear communication, and shared purpose that create extraordinary results. As a developer, the thing I love the most is testing and modernizing legacy code, not just because it improves systems, but because it empowers teams to take ownership of their work and innovate without fear.

I've always been drawn to the "why" behind things. Whether I'm reading essays on psychology and sociology, entertaining myself with philosophy, or diving into communication techniques, I'm constantly exploring what makes teams tick. This curiosity has shaped my coaching approach - I don't just facilitate events, I help teams understand themselves and each other ([watching everything, sending obscure signals...](https://wiki.c2.com/?TheCoach)).

What my colleagues often notice is that I bring technical credibility with genuine empathy. Having written code for many different industries, I understand the daily frustrations developers face. But my studies in active listening and transactional analysis help me create the psychological safety where those frustrations can be addressed constructively.

I'm the type of person who co-founds conferences not for recognition, but because I genuinely believe in building community. I organize events, write articles, and speak at meetups because sharing knowledge feels natural to me. My colleagues in Italy know me as someone who shows up - not just professionally, but as a whole person invested in our collective growth.

I've worked with 80+ teams across banks, startups, and enterprises, and what excites me isn't checking boxes on agile events - it's those moments when a team suddenly clicks. When developers start collaborating instead of competing. When stakeholders begin trusting the process. When everyone realizes they're building something meaningful together.
