I'm in software field since 1999.  

My career began in a high school, where I was a computer science professor. The times when I was not in the classroom I devoted to studying and learning programming, since the schooling I received had not gone beyond dear old Pascal.  

After a few years I made a choice: my career would be that of a programmer. I worked as a developer for several years, ranging from the world of Italian pharmacies, to e-commerce, to industry, making mistakes and learning a lot of the trade.  

It was then, in 2007, that thanks to enlightened colleagues I discovered the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and all that goes with it.  

I began a journey, still ongoing, to discover better ways to develop software and organizations.

Since 2018 I have been a consultant, trainer, coach, and collaborate mainly with [Agile Relaoded](https://www.agilereloaded.it) and [Intr√©](htts://www.intre.it).

I'm member and former advisor of [Italian Agile Movement](https://www.agilemovement.it), an association that takes care of agile disciplines in Italy; every year I contributes to the organization of the [Italian Agile Days](https://www.agileday.it), the biggest conference in Italy about the topic.  

I'm the evil mind behind [Working Software Conference](https://www.agilemovement.it/workingsoftware), a conference dedicated to software development technical practices.  

I love to speak and facilitate workshops at conferences, see [Talks](talks.md) page.  

I wrote a book for [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) about Git, [Git Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&text=Ferdinando+Santacroce&search-alias=books&field-author=Ferdinando+Santacroce&sort=relevancerank "Ferdinando Santacroce on Amazon").
