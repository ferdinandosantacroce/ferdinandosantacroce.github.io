Italian Agile Movement

**Event**: [Italian Agile Movement](http://www.agilemovement.it/)  
**Location**: 🇮🇹 Italy  
**Topic**: Event organization and community building  
**Role**: I've been elected as advisor. I help organizing [Italian Agile Days](http://www.agileday.it/) and many other conferences all around Italy.

In 2017 I focused on organizing events, rather than participating as a speaker 😊
