# Ferdinando Santacroce Blog Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content Quality and Authenticity
Content MUST reflect genuine expertise and lived experience in software development and agile coaching. Every article MUST provide actionable insights or learnings that help readers improve their craft. Content MUST be written from first-person experience, avoiding generic advice or theoretical discussions without practical context.

*Rationale: The blog's value comes from sharing real experiences and hard-won insights from 27+ years in software development and team coaching.*

### II. Multilingual Excellence
All content MUST be available in both English and Italian with equal quality and cultural appropriateness. Translations MUST capture not just literal meaning but cultural context and professional terminology. Language-specific content structure MUST be maintained using Hugo's filename conventions (.en.md, .it.md).

*Rationale: Serving both international and Italian communities requires excellence in both languages, not mere translation.*

### III. Technical Excellence
All code examples, technical discussions, and development guidance MUST be current, tested, and follow industry best practices. Technical content MUST include context about when and why techniques should be applied, not just how. Site implementation MUST be maintainable, performant, and follow Hugo best practices.

*Rationale: Technical credibility requires demonstrated excellence in both content and implementation.*

### IV. Incremental Delivery and Transparency
All content development and site improvements MUST be delivered incrementally with clear commit messages and documentation. Changes MUST be tested locally before deployment. The development process MUST be transparent and exemplify good software development practices.

*Rationale: The site itself serves as an example of professional development practices for readers who are developers.*

## Content Standards

Content development MUST prioritize depth over breadth, focusing on topics where Ferdinando has direct, substantial experience. Articles MUST include specific examples, challenges faced, and lessons learned rather than generic advice. Content MUST maintain professional tone while remaining accessible to developers at different experience levels.

## Technical Excellence

Site architecture MUST be maintainable and follow Hugo best practices. Performance MUST be optimized for fast loading across devices and regions. All custom CSS, icons, and images MUST be properly organized and documented. Development workflow MUST include proper testing and validation before deployment.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and content guidelines. Any amendments require documentation of rationale and impact assessment. All content creation and site development MUST verify compliance with these principles. Content that cannot meet these standards MUST be improved or removed rather than published at lower quality.
